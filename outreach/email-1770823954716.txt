Subject: I built something for Sharp Cuts Barber Shop 👀

Hi Sharp Cuts Barber Shop,

I was searching for local barber shops and noticed you don't have a website yet.

So I built one for you.

**See it here:** https://autonomous-client-engine.vercel.app/demo

It's fully functional, mobile-responsive, and designed to convert visitors into customers. Premium aesthetic with gold accents - same style as high-end barbershops.

**Why I did this:**
- To show you what's possible
- To help your business grow
- Because I believe in delivering before asking

**What's included:**
✓ Hero section with your branding
✓ Services showcase
✓ Contact buttons (phone + email)
✓ Mobile responsive
✓ Fast loading

**No cost to review.**

If you like it, we can customize it further and get it live on your own domain.

Let me know what you think.

Best,
Frank Sharpe
