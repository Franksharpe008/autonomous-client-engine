Hi, this is Frank from Web Design.

I noticed Sharp Cuts Barber Shop doesn't have a website yet, so I built a demo mockup to show you what's possible.

It's a premium design with gold accents, mobile responsive, and ready to convert visitors into customers.

I'd love to share it with you - took me about 20 minutes to build.

Do you have 2 minutes to look at it?

Great! I can send you the link right now. What's your email address?

No pressure - just wanted to show you what's possible. If you like it, we can customize it and get it live on your own domain.

Sound fair?
